# nixos-install-scripts

A collection of one-shot scripts to install NixOS on various server hosters and other hardware.

They are designed to get NixOS onto your machine with minimal effort, usually requiring only a single command and waiting a few minutes.

See the `hosters` directory for available hosters.


## Usage

Each script contains instructions at the top.

You must slighly modify the script, most importantly, to put your login credentials (SSH key) into it.

Some folders also have `README.md` files with addtional hoster-specific tips for NixOS config for and beyond the initial install.
