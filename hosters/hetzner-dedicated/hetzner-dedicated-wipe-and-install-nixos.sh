#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Installs NixOS on a Hetzner server, wiping the server.
#
# This is for a specific server configuration; adjust where needed.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   * Update the script wherever FIXME is present
#
# Usage:
#     ssh root@YOUR_SERVERS_IP bash -s < hetzner-dedicated-wipe-and-install-nixos.sh
#
# When the script is done, make sure to boot the server from HD, not rescue mode again.

# Explanations:
#
# * Adapted from https://gist.github.com/nh2/78d1c65e33806e7728622dbe748c2b6a
# * Following largely https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/index.html#sec-installing-from-other-distro.
# * **Important:** We boot in legacy-BIOS mode, not UEFI, because that's what Hetzner uses.
#   * NVMe devices aren't supported for booting (those require EFI boot)
# * We set a custom `configuration.nix` so that we can connect to the machine afterwards,
#   inspired by https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Install_NixOS_on_Hetzner_Online
# * This server has 2 HDDs.
#   We put everything on RAID1.
#   Storage scheme: `partitions -> RAID -> LVM -> ext4`.
# * A root user with empty password is created, so that you can just login
#   as root and press enter when using the Hetzner spider KVM.
#   Of course that empty-password login isn't exposed to the Internet.
#   Change the password afterwards to avoid anyone with physical access
#   being able to login without any authentication.
# * The script reboots at the end.

# before we even get the chance to wipe them.

# > binary units like "MiB", "GiB", "TiB", etc., parted treats those values as exact
#
# Note: When using `mkpart` on GPT, as per
#   https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/html_node/mkpart.html#mkpart
# the first argument to `mkpart` is not a `part-type`, but the GPT partition name:
#   ... part-type is one of 'primary', 'extended' or 'logical', and may be specified only with 'msdos' or 'dvh' partition tables.
#   A name must be specified for a 'gpt' partition table.
# GPT partition names are limited to 36 UTF-16 chars, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table#Partition_entries_(LBA_2-33).
